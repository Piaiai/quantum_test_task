# quantum_test_task
I have built a neural network for image segmentation based on Unet architechure, using keras.

So the task was to define the nucleus in the image, the data I have taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018 comptetition.

Train.py is the script that will run training of a neural network. While training the neural network I've achieved ~0.87 of target metric (dice coef) on train and validation data.
